    "In the methodology of Transparency International (TI), the Trasparency in Corporate Reporting Index (TRAC Index) is the average of the results of the 10 sections a company has been assessed on. Each section has a different number of questions, and the section result is the weighted average of the questions scores obtained. Each question can be graded on a scale of either 0-1, 0-1-2, or 0-1-2-3, depending on the weight that TI attributes to that particular question in the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every question, in the original Google Spreadsheet, there are 4 columns (Score, Source, URL, Comment) where Source is the document type where the information that underpins the attribution of the score was found, its URL and a Comment that explains why the company has got that Score (explaining how the information retrived satsfies or not TI methodology). \n",

    "\n",
    "1) Extract the raw data from the Google Spreadsheet and create a raw data and a scores only dataframes. \n",
    "2) Use the scores only dataframe to calculate the results of every section, and create a sections results dataframe. \n",
    "3) Use the sections results dataframe to group the companies by sector, recalculate the sections results by group, and \n",
    "   store these results in a sectors dataframe. \n",
    "4) Use the raw data from the Google Spreadsheet to create a .docx for every one of the companies, collating together all \n",
    "   information in the raw data in a document, creating a company profile. \n",
    "5) Create 3 spidercharts for every company, one plotting the sections results of the company only, one plotting the sections    \n",
    "   results of the company with the averages results of sections in the sector of the company, and one plotting the company \n",
    "   sections results with the averages results of the sections of all companies in the sample. \n",
