## Transparency in Corporate Reporting
### Business Integrity Forum 

Transparency International (TI) is one of the pioneers in the fight for a more transparent corporate reporting. Being the leader of anti-corruption standards in the world, the Business Inegrity team of TI created what are now known in the compliance industry the [Business Principles for Countering Bribery (BPCB)](https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/business_principles_for_countering_bribery) and its [Commentary](https://www.transparency.org/files/content/publication/2015_BusinessPrinciplesCommentary_EN.pdf) which act as a go to resource for multinationals designing their anti-corruption programmes. 

Based on the best practices laid down in the BPCP, the Business Integrity team developed a questionnaire to assess the level of adherence of multinationals to the BPCB, giving birth to the [Transparency in Corporate Reporting (TRAC)](https://www.transparency.org/files/content/feature/2016_TRACEMM_Index.png), a study which has already been conducted several times in [2009](https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/transparency_in_reporting_on_anti_corruption_a_report_on_corporate_practice), [2011](https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/promoting_revenue_transparency_2011_report_on_oil_and_gas_companies), [2012](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/shining-a-light-on-the-worlds-biggest-companies), [2013](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/emerging_market_multinational_companies_ready_for_prime_time), [2014](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/global_companies_global_transparency), [2015](https://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/publication/transparency_in_corporate_reporting_assessing_the_worlds_largest_telecommun), and [2016](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/emerging_markets_pathetic_transparency). 

This year, the Italian antenna created the first iteration of its TRAC, assessing the transparency and strength of anti-corruption programmes of 50 Italian Multinationals.
